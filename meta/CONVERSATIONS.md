# Conversations

**Purpose**: Track up to 7 concurrent development conversations/stories for theCy+reBe ecosystem

---

## Overview

The rebe-simulations workspace supports up to **7 concurrent conversations** following the 5±2 rule (Miller's Law). Each conversation is a focused development effort building, evolving, simulating, using, deploying, supporting, or teaching components and user experiences.

**Cognitive Rationale**: Human working memory can hold 5±2 items. Limiting conversations to 7 maximum ensures:
- Clear focus on each conversation
- Manageable cognitive load
- Proper context switching
- Complete documentation per conversation

## Conversation Management

### Starting a New Conversation

**Prerequisites**:
1. Maximum 7 concurrent active conversations
2. Clear problem definition and scope
3. Dependencies identified and planned
4. Conversation number assigned (001-007)

**Process**:
1. Create directory: `conversations/NNN-name/`
2. Create `README.md` with:
   - Purpose and context
   - Key components (5±2 rule)
   - Architecture overview
   - Development status
   - Success criteria
3. Update this file (CONVERSATIONS.md) with conversation details
4. Commit with message: "feat: Start conversation NNN: name"

### Pausing a Conversation

**Reasons**:
- Waiting on dependencies from other conversations
- Resource constraints
- Reprioritization

**Process**:
1. Document current state in conversation README
2. Update status in this file to 🟡 Paused
3. Document blocking issues and required resolutions
4. Commit with message: "pause: Conversation NNN: reason"

### Completing a Conversation

**Criteria**:
- All success criteria met
- Documentation complete
- Tests passing (>90% coverage)
- Deployed to production or ready for deployment

**Process**:
1. Final documentation update
2. Tag release: `conversation-NNN-complete`
3. Update status in this file to 🔵 Complete
4. Commit with message: "complete: Conversation NNN: summary"

### Archiving a Conversation

**When**:
- Conversation complete and stable for >6 months
- No active development needed

**Process**:
1. Move from `conversations/` to `archived/`
2. Preserve all documentation and git history
3. Update this file to reflect archive status
4. Commit with message: "archive: Conversation NNN: moved to archive"

## Integration Points

### Shared Components (`/components/`)
Conversations may share common libraries:
- `components/protocol/` - Shared protocol definitions
- `components/types/` - Common type definitions
- `components/utils/` - Utility functions

### Shared Configuration (`/shared/configs/`)
Common configuration templates:
- Docker compose files
- Kubernetes manifests
- Environment variable templates

### Shared Scripts (`/shared/scripts/`)
Common build and deployment scripts:
- `build-all.sh` - Build all conversations
- `test-all.sh` - Run all test suites
- `deploy.sh` - Deployment automation

---

## Conversation Isolation

**Principle**: Each conversation should be:
1. **Self-contained**: Can be built and tested independently
2. **Documented**: Complete documentation within conversation folder
3. **Versioned**: Independent version numbers
4. **Deployable**: Can be deployed independently (microservices)

**Exception**: Shared components in `/components/` are allowed for:
- Protocol definitions
- Common types
- Utility functions

But must be versioned and treated as dependencies.
