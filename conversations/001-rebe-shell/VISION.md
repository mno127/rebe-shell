# rebe-shell Vision

**The execution substrate for autonomous infrastructure management at planetary scale.**

## Origin Story

### The Problem Discovery

In October 2025, while analyzing the reBe infrastructure discovery system, a critical architectural flaw was uncovered:

**Current Node.js/SSH implementation:**
- Serial execution: 2 seconds per node
- 20M nodes × 2s = **46 days** for single discovery pass
- String concatenation creates O(n²) memory complexity
- Complex pipe chains (`cat | grep | head | cut`) fail silently
- No timeouts, no retries, no circuit breakers
- Brittle text parsing breaks on locale changes

**The realization:**
> "None of these approaches seem reliable, consistent, repeatable and suitable for a one hundred percent fully autonomous and automated, scalable to millions of instances executing flows and activities issued by higher-level orchestrators executing for reBe users that are technically illiterate."

This was not just a performance problem. It was an **architectural impossibility**. You cannot build reliable autonomous systems on unreliable foundations.

### The Design Constraint

**Primary constraint**: The end users are technically illiterate.

This is not a bug—it's the entire point. reBe exists to democratize infrastructure management. If the system requires users to understand exit codes, SIGPIPE errors, or SSH connection pooling, **we have failed**.

**Implication**: The robots must be 100% reliable. There is no user who can fix problems.

### The Insight

Traditional shells were designed for **human operators**:
- Humans can retry failed commands
- Humans can interpret ambiguous output
- Humans can detect when something looks wrong
- Humans work serially (one task at a time)

But **autonomous robots** need:
- Structured data, not text to parse
- Automatic retry with backoff
- Explicit errors, never ambiguous output
- Massive parallelism (thousands of concurrent operations)

**Conclusion**: We need a shell designed for robots, not humans.

## Strategic Intent

### What We Are Building

**rebe-shell is:**
- An execution substrate for robot agents
- A cross-platform terminal for human developers
- A structured API for infrastructure operations
- A safe sandbox for command preview
- A distributed orchestration platform

**rebe-shell is NOT:**
- A replacement for bash/zsh for interactive use
- A general-purpose programming language
- A configuration management tool (use Ansible/Chef/etc)
- A monitoring system (use Prometheus/Grafana/etc)

### Design Principles

#### 1. Reliability Over Performance

**Principle**: A slow, correct answer beats a fast, wrong answer.

**Example**:
```rust
// ✅ Safe: Timeout ensures we don't hang forever
let result = execute_with_timeout(cmd, 30s)?;

// ❌ Fast but unreliable: No timeout
let result = execute(cmd)?;
```

**Rationale**: Autonomous systems cannot tolerate silent failures. Better to fail explicitly and retry than to hang indefinitely.

#### 2. Structured Over Textual

**Principle**: Always prefer structured data (JSON, typed structs) over text parsing.

**Example**:
```rust
// ✅ Structured API
let cpu: CpuInfo = system::get_cpu_info()?;
assert!(cpu.cores > 0);

// ❌ Text parsing
let output = exec("nproc")?;
let cores = output.trim().parse::<u32>()?;  // Can fail!
```

**Rationale**: Text parsing is brittle to locale, formatting changes, and unexpected output. Structured data has explicit schemas and validation.

#### 3. Explicit Over Implicit

**Principle**: Make errors, timeouts, and resource limits explicit in the API.

**Example**:
```rust
// ✅ Explicit constraints
pub async fn execute(
    cmd: &str,
    timeout: Duration,
    max_output_bytes: usize,
) -> Result<CommandOutput, ExecutionError>

// ❌ Implicit behavior
pub async fn execute(cmd: &str) -> Result<String>
```

**Rationale**: Implicit behavior leads to surprising failures. Explicit constraints allow callers to make informed decisions.

#### 4. Isolation Over Integration

**Principle**: Sandbox by default, integrate with permission.

**Example**:
```rust
// ✅ Sandboxed execution
let preview = wasm_sandbox.execute(cmd)?;
if user_approves(&preview) {
    pty.execute_native(cmd)?;
}

// ❌ Direct execution
pty.execute(cmd)?;
```

**Rationale**: Destructive commands should be previewable. WASM sandbox provides read-only filesystem view.

#### 5. Parallelism Over Serialism

**Principle**: Default to concurrent execution, serialize only when necessary.

**Example**:
```rust
// ✅ Parallel execution
let futures = nodes.iter().map(|n| discover(n));
let results = join_all(futures).await;

// ❌ Serial execution
for node in nodes {
    let result = discover(node).await?;
}
```

**Rationale**: Modern infrastructure requires millions of operations. Serial execution is a non-starter.

### Strategic Bets

#### Bet 1: WASM is the Future of Portable Compute

**Thesis**: WebAssembly will become the dominant format for portable, sandboxed code execution.

**Why**:
- Language-agnostic (write plugins in Rust, Go, C++, etc)
- Security by default (capability-based sandbox)
- Near-native performance
- Cross-platform (same binary on Mac/Win/Linux)

**Risk**: WASM ecosystem still maturing, tooling gaps exist

**Mitigation**: Provide native fallbacks, contribute to WASM ecosystem

#### Bet 2: AI Will Be the Primary Interface for Infrastructure

**Thesis**: By 2028, most infrastructure operations will be initiated via natural language, not CLI commands.

**Why**:
- LLMs can translate intent to technical operations
- Autonomous agents need natural language interfaces
- Non-technical users cannot learn CLI syntax

**Risk**: AI hallucination could cause destructive operations

**Mitigation**: WASM sandbox for preview, explicit user confirmation for destructive ops

#### Bet 3: Infrastructure Will Reach Planetary Scale

**Thesis**: Millions of nodes will be common by 2030 (IoT, edge computing, home labs).

**Why**:
- Home infrastructure growing (2M homes × 10 devices = 20M nodes)
- Edge computing explosion (CDN, 5G, IoT)
- Multi-cloud becoming standard

**Risk**: Coordination overhead could dominate at extreme scale

**Mitigation**: Hierarchical architecture (regional agents), eventual consistency

#### Bet 4: Reliability Requires Structured APIs

**Thesis**: Text-based CLI output will be recognized as an anti-pattern for autonomous systems.

**Why**:
- Parsing is brittle
- Silent failures are common
- Locale-dependent
- No schema validation

**Risk**: Requires buy-in from tool authors to provide structured output

**Mitigation**: Provide adapters for legacy tools, build structured APIs for new tools

## Cognitive Artifacts

### Key Insights Captured

**Insight 1**: String concatenation for output capture is O(n²)
- **Date**: 2025-10-20
- **Context**: Analyzing reBe discovery code
- **Learning**: JavaScript's `stdout += data.toString()` creates new string each time
- **Solution**: Use array of buffers, concatenate once at end
- **Impact**: Memory usage reduced from O(n²) to O(n)

**Insight 2**: Pipe failures are silent by default
- **Date**: 2025-10-20
- **Context**: Reviewing complex shell pipelines in discovery code
- **Learning**: `cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "missing" | head -1` returns empty string if grep finds nothing, NOT an error
- **Solution**: Validate output is non-empty, use structured APIs instead of pipes
- **Impact**: Prevents corrupt data from entering database

**Insight 3**: Serial execution cannot scale beyond 1K nodes
- **Date**: 2025-10-20
- **Context**: Calculating discovery time for 20M nodes
- **Learning**: 2s per node × 20M = 46 days (vs 5-minute requirement)
- **Solution**: Parallel workers + distributed agents + connection pooling
- **Impact**: 20M nodes in 100 seconds (4000x faster)

**Insight 4**: Technical users can debug; non-technical users cannot
- **Date**: 2025-10-20
- **Context**: Discussing user stories for reBe infrastructure
- **Learning**: "reBe users are technically illiterate" = system must be 100% reliable
- **Solution**: WASM sandbox for preview, plain English errors, automatic retry
- **Impact**: Changes requirement from "usually works" to "always works"

### Beliefs & Assumptions

**Belief 1**: Cross-platform portability is essential
- **Why**: Users work on Mac, Windows, and Linux
- **Evidence**: Market fragmentation, no dominant platform
- **Challenge**: Would require maintaining 3 codebases without Tauri
- **Validated**: Not yet

**Belief 2**: WASM provides sufficient performance
- **Why**: Near-native speed, ~95% of native in benchmarks
- **Evidence**: wasm-opt optimization, SIMD support
- **Challenge**: Some operations (filesystem) have overhead
- **Validated**: Not yet (needs benchmarking)

**Belief 3**: Users will accept 30-50MB binary size
- **Why**: Disk space is cheap, reliability is expensive
- **Evidence**: VS Code (~200MB), Docker Desktop (~500MB) are popular
- **Challenge**: May be too large for embedded/IoT devices
- **Validated**: Not yet

**Belief 4**: SSH will remain dominant protocol for remote execution
- **Why**: Ubiquitous, secure, firewall-friendly
- **Evidence**: 30+ years of production use
- **Challenge**: HTTP/gRPC gaining traction for APIs
- **Validated**: Partially (SSH still standard for infrastructure)

### Open Questions

**Question 1**: How do we handle network partitions at scale?
- **Context**: 2000 regional agents managing 20M nodes
- **Challenge**: Network split could separate coordinator from agents
- **Options**:
  - Eventual consistency (agents operate autonomously)
  - Strict consistency (halt on partition)
  - Hybrid (critical ops halt, read-only continues)
- **Decision**: Not yet made

**Question 2**: What is the plugin security model?
- **Context**: WASM plugins have capability-based security
- **Challenge**: Balance convenience vs security
- **Options**:
  - Strict: No filesystem access by default
  - Permissive: Plugins request capabilities
  - Hybrid: Readonly by default, write with permission
- **Decision**: Hybrid approach (readonly + explicit grants)

**Question 3**: How do we version the command protocol?
- **Context**: Structured command API will evolve over time
- **Challenge**: Backward compatibility with old clients/servers
- **Options**:
  - Semantic versioning (break compatibility on major versions)
  - Protocol negotiation (client/server agree on version)
  - Infinite backward compat (never break old APIs)
- **Decision**: Protocol negotiation (preferred)

**Question 4**: Should rebe-shell support Windows natively or via WSL?
- **Context**: Windows has different shell model (cmd.exe, PowerShell)
- **Challenge**: Native Windows support = 2x implementation complexity
- **Options**:
  - Native: Implement both POSIX and Windows shells
  - WSL: Require WSL2 for Windows users
  - Hybrid: PowerShell for native, bash via WSL
- **Decision**: Start with WSL, evaluate native based on demand

rebe-shell is not just a terminal. It is the **execution substrate for autonomous infrastructure management**.

The vision is ambitious: enable technically illiterate users to manage planetary-scale infrastructure (20M+ nodes) through natural language intent, executed by autonomous robots with 100% reliability.

This requires rethinking shell fundamentals:
- Structured over textual
