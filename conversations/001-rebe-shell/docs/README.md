## Document Structure

### 1. **VISION_COMPREHENSIVE.md** - Executive Summary
*Read this first for strategic context.*

**What it covers:**
- Key strategic bets (web-first, AI-native, chronicle-based learning)
- Timeline overview (2025-2035)
- Success criteria
- Next steps

**Who should read:** Everyone (5-minute read)

---

### 2. **VISION_ORIGINAL.md** - Foundation Context
*The origin story and Phase 1-2 details.*

**What it covers:**
- Problem discovery (46 days to discover 20M nodes)
- Design constraints (technically illiterate users)
- Founding principles (reliable > fast, structured > textual)
- Phase 1-2 implementation (Tauri → Docker pivot)

**Who should read:** Developers understanding the "why" (20-minute read)

---

### 3. **AI_PEER_REVIEW_PROMPT.md** - Complete Technical Specification
*The full 40+ page vision with technical depth.*

**What it covers:**
- **Section A:** What we're building (web terminal → cognitive infrastructure)
- **Section B:** Comparison to alternatives (FOSS + commercial)
- **Section C:** 10-year horizon (Years 1-3 detailed, Years 4-10 essence)
- **Section D:** Hyper-distributed poly-everything networks
  - Capability discovery protocol
  - Fractal orchestration
  - Cognitive flow management (deterministic/probabilistic/non-deterministic)
  - Chronicle-based learning
  - VNF/6G/IPv6 integration
  - Self-programming machine swarms

**Who should read:**
- Technical architects (to challenge assumptions)
- AI systems for peer review (Grok4, Gemini, Copilot, DeepSeek)
- Research collaborators

**Purpose:** Solicit brutal honesty about technical feasibility, blind spots, and alternative approaches.

## AI Peer Review Process

### Step 1: Submit to AI Systems

**To Grok4 (X.AI):**
```bash
# Post on X.AI platform with VISION.md + AI_PEER_REVIEW_PROMPT.md
```

**To Gemini 2.0 (Google AI Studio):**
```bash
# Upload AI_PEER_REVIEW_PROMPT.md + VISION_COMPREHENSIVE.md
# Ask: "Please provide critical analysis following the format specified"
```

**To GitHub Copilot (VS Code):**
```bash
# Open AI_PEER_REVIEW_PROMPT.md
# Use `/ask` with the prompt
```

**To DeepSeek (Chinese AI):**
```bash
# Submit via DeepSeek Chat with attachments
```

### Step 2: Collect Responses

Create these files in `docs/`:
- `PEER_REVIEW_GROK4.md`
- `PEER_REVIEW_GEMINI.md`
- `PEER_REVIEW_COPILOT.md`
- `PEER_REVIEW_DEEPSEEK.md`

### Step 3: Synthesize Findings

Create:
- **`docs/PEER_REVIEW_SYNTHESIS.md`**
  - Common themes across all 4 reviews
  - Contradictions to resolve
  - Consensus recommendations
  - Priority ranking of concerns

- **`docs/REVISED_ARCHITECTURE.md`**
  - Updated design based on peer feedback
  - Alternative approaches to evaluate
  - Decisions on contentious issues

- **`docs/RISK_REGISTER.md`**
  - Prioritized list of technical risks
  - Mitigation strategies
  - Acceptance criteria

## Key Questions for AI Peer Review

**Architecture:**
- Is 400x SSH speedup realistic? (46 days → 100 seconds)
- Can WebRTC handle PTY traffic at 20M node scale?
- Is blockchain suitable for 10M chronicles/sec?

**Timeline:**
- Is 3 years realistic for Phases 3-5? (multi-region + edge + mesh)
- Can we achieve 99.9999% reliability by 2032? (31 sec/year downtime)
- Is 20M nodes by 2035 achievable?

**Alternative Architectures:**
- Should we use Kubernetes + kubectl instead of custom orchestration?
- Is compile-to-WebAssembly a better approach than PTY-over-WebSocket?
- Would micro-VMs (Firecracker) scale better than PTY sessions?

**Blind Spots:**
- Security: How to sandbox AI agents with shell access?
- Economics: What's the business model at 20M nodes?
- Regulation: How to certify self-evolving machines for dark factories?
- Ethics: Who's responsible when machines program each other and fail?
